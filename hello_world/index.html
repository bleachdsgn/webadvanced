				I was born in Kingston, Jamaica but I grew up in America. Although reggae music is the most popular genre of music to come out of Jamaica, dancehall is the most popular within Jamaica. Exploring dancehall music and culture has been a bridge for me to learn more about my country of origin and to form a cultural bond.
