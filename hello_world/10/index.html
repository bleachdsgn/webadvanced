Jamaica has become increasingly open to foreign interpretations of its domestic sounds, case in point: the growing local popularity of EDM-dancehall hybrid music. It’s clear that the audience is there and the market is ready for a new dancehall star, it’s just a matter of all the right people continuing to work together to make it happen.
